Hello world! I am Samuel de Medeiros Queiroz, a bachelor in Computer Science
who is seeking for challenges in the free and open source world.

I like to work in teams in which the mission statement is clearly to make the
world better somehow. That is one of the reasons I am currently working in a
great team at Hewllet Packard Enterprise, where I am fully focused on upstream
work for the OpenStack community.

Helping onboarding newcomers in the community is a mission I value. I was a
mentor for the 2016's May-August round of the Outreachy program.

I enjoy travelling the world talking about Open Source and OpenStack software,
allowing me to share my knowledge and perceptions, while meeting new people
and gaining experiences.

Besides participating in events, I enjoy organizing events in order to bring
awareness about Open Source and OpenStack to local communities. As an instance
of that, in November 2016, I organized the first OpenStack Day in Natal,
Brazil.

In this website you will find information about the talks I have given, the
articles I have published, my résumé and more about me.
