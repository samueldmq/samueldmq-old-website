The linux.conf.au is one of the worldâ€™s greatest Free and Open Source Software
conferences. Having the opportunity learn more about free and open source,
while being able to present a talk and to meet great people was an outstanding
experience for me.
</p>

<p align="justify">
In collaboration with two colleages at Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Masayuki
Igawa and Dong Ma, this talk shared our experiences as non-native English
speakers in open source communities where English is the official language,
more specifically highlighting what have worked for us while working in the
OpenStack community.
</p>

This talk enumerated a few communication and cultural challenges, as well as
what we have done to overcome them. In addition, a few tips were given in
order to ease the process of onboarding newcomers in free and opensource
communities, specially if they are non-native English speakers.
