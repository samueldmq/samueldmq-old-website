I joined Hewlett Packard Enterprise back in September 2015, and it was
my very first job. Today is my last day at HPE and I would like to
let everyone know that I am very proud of the time I spent there.
</p>

<p align="justify">
In HPE, I was part of a team called the Dead Parrot Society (DPS),
where I was trusted to prioritize my own work with the goal to make the
OpenStack community better, as part of the HPE's commitment to open
source.
</p>

<p align="justify">
First, I kept focused on keystone, which rapidly allowed me to acquire
core reviewer status. Then I started participating and talking at
conferences, which is something I definitely enjoy a lot.
</p>

<p align="justify">
In order to help spreading open source and OpenStack awareness in
Brazil, I organized the first OpenStack Day in Natal. Finally, last
year, I was proudly a mentor in the Outreachy program.
</p>

<p align="justify">
I am very proud of all the work I was able to accomplish with the
support of my team.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Besides being a team full of awesome people, the DPS is a place where
good values are cultivated: collaboration, proactiveness, trust,
transparency, hardwork, etc. These I will for sure carry for the rest
of my life. I am lucky to have had the change to be part of this team.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Talking about my next step, tomorrow I am officially joining SUSE,
where I intend to continue my journey on making open source and
OpenStack better, as I keep learning and improving myself.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Finally, I would like to say thank you to all the parrots for the time
we have spent together, it was a pleasure for me to learn with each one
of you.
</p>

<p align="justify">
A special thanks to Jim Meyer and Allison Randal for their continued
support of my open source involvement and to Ghe Rivero and Vicky for
being awesome managers during this part of my journey.
</p>

<p align="justify">
In terms of helping me to draw my career plan and giving me advices,
thank you again Vicky and Allison for your support and time, I really
appreciate it.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Again, thank you.
</p>

<p align="center">See you all around!</p>
