FOSSASIA is the premier Free and Open Source technology organization in Asia for
developers, designers, start-ups, and contributors. This annual FOSSASIA summit
took place in the Science Centre of Singapore.

In collaboration with two colleages, Masayuki Igawa and Dong Ma, this talk shared
our experiences as non-native English speakers in open source communities where
English is the official language, more specifically highlighting what have worked
for us while working in the OpenStack community.
</p>

<p align="justify">
This talk enumerated a few communication and cultural challenges, as well as
what we have done to overcome them. In addition, a few tips were given in
order to ease the process of onboarding newcomers in free and opensource
communities, specially if they are non-native English speakers.
