<p align="justify">
I was invited by professor Tha√≠s Batista from the Federal University of Rio
Grande do Norte to give her students a lecture about cloud computing with
OpenStack.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The class was pretty interested on the subject and learned what OpenStack is,
its core projects, philosophy and events.
</p>

<p align="justify">
In addition, I shared a little bit of what I do daily and highlighted that
OpenStack is plenty of opportunities in the case they are interested on
joining it.
