<p align="justify">
In the Week of Technology and Innovation, I gave a talk with the goal of
educating about cloud computing and OpenStack, sharing with the audience how
adopting a cloud solution may ease the process of launching, maintaining and
scalating the infrastucture needed for running their apps.

I have done a live demonstration on launching virtual machines with virtual
networks, floating IPs, etc with an OpenStack cloud for an audience of
approximately 50 people.
