OpenStack Days are regional events organized and normally hosted annually with the
goal to disseminate Python as a programming language and as a community. This
specific Python Day happened in Campina Grande, Paraíba, Brazil and I was invited
by Gustavo Diniz, the event main organizer to give a keynote.

<p align="justify">
This keynote talk was about how OpenStack makes Python better, and vice-versa.
It highlighted how the use of Python as the primary language helps OpenStack to
be successful and, on the other hand, how the Python community benefits from
having such a big and important project that is OpenStack written with it.

The audience of around 130 people was very interested on the talk and seemed
to be very impressed by the facts and numbers presented, such as the number of
21k test runs in a typical work day in OpenStack.

This presentation was inspired on the talk “HOW OPENSTACK MAKES PYTHON BETTER
(and vice-versa)”, from Doug Hellmann and Thierry Carrez at EuroPython 2016.
