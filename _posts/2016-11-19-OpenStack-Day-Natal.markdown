OpenStack Days are regional events organized and hosted annually with the
support of the OpenStack Foundation by local OpenStack user groups and
companies in the ecosystem, and are often one or two-day events with keynotes,
breakout sessions and even workshops. The goal is to bring together IT
executives, cloud operators and technology providers to discuss cloud
computing and learn about OpenStack.

I was the main organizer of this event that was the first in the Nordeste
region of Brazil, happening in Natal, Rio Grande do Norte. The audience was
about 100 people, where most of them were interested on learning what
OpenStack is and how to get started.

As the main organizer, I gave the opening and closing talks, where I
highlighted the importance of OpenStack in the future of cloud computing and
encouraged people to try OpenStack at their organizations.
