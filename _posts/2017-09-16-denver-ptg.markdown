<p align="justify">
The OpenStack Project Teams Gathering at Denver was focused on technical
discussions defining the roadmap for the Queens release cycle. With funding
from my employer, SUSE, I was able to attend and focus on keystone related
discussions.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The main technical discussions were around the following topics:
<ul>
  <li>Policy in Code, mainly helping other teams to define their policies
  in their code, since that is a cross-project goal established by the TC and
  had already been completed by keystone;</li>
  <li>RBAC Improvements, with new changes proposing some solutions for the
  current gaps for authorization management in OpenStack;</li>
  <li>Application Credentials describing an alternative way for applications
  to communicate with OpenStack services without having user accounts;</li>
  <li>Microversions approach adoption, which is a cross-project subject that
  defines a versioning strategy for OpenStack services;</li>
  <li>Deprecations & Removals, with the notable removal of the keystone v2.0 APIs;</li>
  <li>Docs cleanup, which has greatly improved with an Outreachy mentee during the
  Pike release cycle. There is quite a bunch of work to be done yet;</li>
  <li>Testing, which should continue to be improved in complex scenarios such
  as Identity Federation and LDAP backends.
</ul>

There were some other topics that were not technical, but focused on the
keystone team:

<ul>
  <li>Mission Statement and Long-term Vision for the project;</li>
  <li>Pike retrospective, which was a great exercise praising what had
  had been done well and what could had been done better, with action items.</li>
</ul>

There are two very well written summaries for the PTG:

is written by Lance Bragstad, the keystone Project Team Leader (PTL), and
