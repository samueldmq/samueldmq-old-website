<p align="justify">
The Brazilian Symposium on Computer Networks and Distributed Systems has
become, in its more than three decades, the most important national scientific
event on computer networks and distributed systems.
</p>

I was invited by professor Andrey Brito from the Federal University of Campina
Grande to give a tutorial with him about cloud computing with OpenStack,
showing the benefits of being an open source and modular project, making it a
very fertile environment for innovation.

In that tutorial, we have walked the audience through its core services up to
others like Analytics-As-A-Service. In addition, there was a live
demonstration of some usecases like creating a new virtual machine using an
OpenStack cloud.
