As stated in the home page, I am Samuel de Medeiros Queiroz and I am seeking
for challenges in the free and open source world, and I also enjoy travelling
the world talking about Open Source and OpenStack software.
</p>

<p align="justify">
I like to work in teams in which the mission statement is clearly to make the
world better somehow. That is one of the reasons I am currently working in a
great team at Hewllet Packard Enterprise, where I am fully focused on upstream
work for the OpenStack community.

Helping onboarding newcomers in the community is a mission I value. I was a
mentor for the 2016's May-August round of the Outreachy program.

Besides participating in events, I enjoy organizing events in order to bring
awareness about Open Source and OpenStack to local communities. As an instance
of that, in November 2016, I organized the first OpenStack Day in Natal,
Brazil.
